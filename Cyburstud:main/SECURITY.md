## Reporting a Vulnerability
## Sumitting a chang
Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

You’re making changes in a project you don’t have write access to.
Submitting a change will write it to a new branch in your fork mrpapuricem/docs, so you can send a pull request.
